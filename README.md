# SearchField Issue Resolution Project

## Overview

This project contains my solution to a technical challenge involving the `SearchField` component. The challenge was to resolve specific issues affecting the functionality of the component, primarily focusing on input focus management and `ngModel` binding behavior.

## Resolved Issues

1. **Focus Retention on Clear**: Implemented a solution to ensure that the input field retains focus after the clear button is pressed.
2. **ngModel Binding Fix**: Corrected the behavior of the input field to ensure proper functionality with or without `ngModel` binding.

## Approach

I approached the challenge by carefully analyzing the existing code and identifying the root causes of the issues. After pinpointing the problematic areas, I implemented fixes that resolved these issues while ensuring that the original functionality of the component was maintained.

## Testing

The fixes are thoroughly tested with unit tests added in `search-field.component.cy.ts`. These tests validate the correct behavior of the component post-fixes.

## How to Run

To review the solution and run the tests:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run the Cypress tests to observe the resolved behavior.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- Cypress for unit testing

## Conclusion

This project showcases my problem-solving skills and understanding of TypeScript and testing with Cypress. The solution aligns with the provided acceptance criteria, ensuring that the `SearchField` component behaves as expected under various scenarios.

## Feedback

I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
